A comprehensive web-based system designed to streamline and enhance the monitoring and analysis of student performance in educational institutions. SPMS 4.0 empowers both students and faculty to track academic progress, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to optimize learning outcomes.

## Project Overview

SPMS 4.0 is a reimagined version of an existing student performance monitoring system (SPMS 2.0). It addresses the limitations of the previous system by introducing a more user-friendly interface, enhanced data management capabilities, and advanced reporting features. The system is built on a relational database management system (RDBMS) to ensure data integrity and efficient retrieval.

## Key Features

*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design for easy navigation and interaction by students, faculty, and administrators.
*   **Comprehensive Data Collection:** Captures student data, including grades, course outcomes (COs), and program learning outcomes (PLOs).
*   **Automated Calculation:** Automatically calculates course outcome percentages based on obtained grades.
*   **Progress Tracking:** Allows students and faculty to monitor individual and overall class performance trends.
*   **CQI Reporting:** Generates Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) reports to identify areas for curriculum enhancement, including:
    *   Student enrollment trends
    *   Course-wise and instructor-wise performance trends
    *   PLO achievement analysis
*   **Data Import/Export:** Supports data import from CSV files and export for further analysis.
*   **Customizable:** Adaptable to different educational institutions and their specific requirements.

## Technical Details

*   **Programming Languages:** PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
*   **Database:** MySQL
*   **Tools:** MySQL Workbench, XAMPP


## How It Works

1.  **Data Input:** Faculty members input student data (grades, etc.) manually or import it from CSV files.
2.  **Data Storage:** The system securely stores data in a MySQL database.
3.  **Calculation and Analysis:** SPMS 4.0 automatically calculates CO percentages and generates various reports (CQI, performance trends).
4.  **Visualization:** Presents data through intuitive graphs and charts.
5.  **Access and Review:** Students and faculty access personalized dashboards to view performance and progress.

## Benefits

*   **Improved Student Performance:** Students can identify areas for improvement.
*   **Enhanced Faculty Insights:** Faculty can tailor teaching strategies based on data.
*   **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Administrators can make informed decisions about curriculum and resources.
*   **Streamlined Processes:** Automation saves time and reduces manual effort.


## Future Enhancements

*   **Automated Marking:** Implement automated marking for objective assessments.
*   **Code Analysis:** Integrate a code compiler for evaluating programming assignments.
*   **Enhanced Access Control:** Provide role-based access control for different user types.
*   **Mobile App:** Develop a mobile app for convenient access.
